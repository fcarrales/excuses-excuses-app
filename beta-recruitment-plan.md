```
Hey [Name]! 

I just finished building a fun web app called "Excuses, Excuses!" and I'd love your feedback before launching it publicly.

It's a creative excuse generator with features like SMS proof sending and multi-language support. Takes about 10-15 minutes to test.

If you're on the same Wi-Fi as me: http://172.20.10.10:3000
Otherwise I'll send you a public link soon!

Would you mind testing it out and filling out a quick feedback form? Your honest opinion would mean the world to me! üôè

Thanks!
